# ECG Displayer

A Python based App created in order to visualize ECG signals and to associate to them cardiac events to determine the status of the patient. The App is made to be the most easy to use for the user. 
Both Python code and Executable are available in order to directly use it. 
Currently only adapted for Creighton University ECG Database but can be easily adapted.
